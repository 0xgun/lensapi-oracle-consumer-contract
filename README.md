## Overview
This project represents a basic Polygon Consumer Contract that is compatible with a deployed LensAPI Oracle via [Phat Bricks UI](https://bricks.phala.network).

## Prerequisites
- Active deployed LensAPI Oracle Blueprint via [Phat Bricks](https://bricks.phala.network)
- Address of the "[Oracle Endpoint](https://docs.phala.network/developers/bricks-and-blueprints/featured-blueprints/lensapi-oracle#step-3-connect-your-smart-contract-to-the-oracle)" in deployed LensAPI Oracle
- [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org)
- For Polygon Mainnet deployments:
  - Polygonscan API Key that can be generated on [polygonscan](https://polygonscan.com)
- RPC Endpoint for Polygon Mainnet & Mumbai Testnet
  - [Alchemy](https://alchemy.com) - This repo example uses Alchemy's API Key.
  - [Infura](https://infura.io)
  - Personal RPC Node
- Polkadot Account for Phala PoC5 Testnet and Mainnet deployment

## Getting Started
First you will need to run `cp .env.local .env` to copy over the local environment variables.
> If you are looking for how to test your custom JS function locally before deploying to PoC5 Testnet or Mainnet, check out the [README.md](./src/README.md) in the `./src/` directory.
> 

### Environment Variables:
- `MUMBAI_RPC_URL` - JSON-RPC URL with an API key for RPC endpoints on Polygon Mumbai Testnet (e.g. [Alchemy](https://alchemy.com) `https://polygon-mumbai.g.alchemy.com/v2/<api-key>`, [Infura](https://infura.io) `https://polygon.infura.io/v3/<api-key>`).
- `POLYGON_RPC_URL` - JSON-RPC URL with an API key for RPC endpoints on Polygon Mainnet (e.g. [Alchemy](https://alchemy.com) `https://polygon.g.alchemy.com/v2/<api-key>`, [Infura](https://infura.io) `https://polygon.infura.io/v3/<api-key>`).
- `DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY` - Secret key for the deployer account that will deploy the Consumer Contract on either Polygon Mainnet or Polygon Mumbai Testnet.
- `POLYGONSCAN_API_KEY` - Polygonscan API Key that can be generated at [polygonscan](https://polygonscan.com).
- `MUMBAI_LENSAPI_ORACLE_ENDPOINT` - LensAPI Oracle Endpoint Address that can be found in the dashboard of the deployed LensAPI Oracle Blueprint at [Phala PoC5 Testnet](https://bricks-poc5.phala.network) for Polygon Mumbai Testnet.
- `POLYGON_LENSAPI_ORACLE_ENDPOINT` - LensAPI Oracle Endpoint Address that can be found in the dashboard of the deployed LensAPI Oracle Blueprint at [Phala Mainnet](https://bricks.phala.network) for Polygon Mainnet.

## Deployment
Now that you have the prerequisites to deploy a Polygon Consumer Contract on Polygon, lets begin with some initials tasks.
### Install Dependencies & Compile Contracts
```shell
# install dependencies
$ yarn

# compile contracts
$ yarn compile
```
### Deploy to Polygon Mumbai Testnet
With the contracts successfully compiled, now we can begin deploying first to Polygon Mumbai Testnet. If you have not gotten `MATIC` for Mumbai Testnet then get `MATIC` from a [faucet](https://mumbaifaucet.com/).
Ensure to save the address after deploying the Consumer Contract because this address will be use in the "[Configure Client](https://docs.phala.network/developers/bricks-and-blueprints/featured-blueprints/lensapi-oracle#step-4-configure-the-client-address)" section of Phat Bricks UI. The deployed address will also be set to the environment variable [`MUMBAI_CONSUMER_CONTRACT_ADDRESS`](./.env.local).
```bash
yarn test-deploy
```
```shell
# deploy contracts to testnet mumbai

```
#### Verify Contract on Polygon Mumbai Testnet
Ensure to update the [`mumbai.arguments.ts`](./mumbai.arguments.ts) file with the constructor arguments used to instantiate the Consumer Contract. If you add additional parameters to the constructor function then make sure to update the `mumbai.arguments.ts` file.
> **Note**: Your contract address will be different than `0x090E8fDC571d65459569BC87992C1026121DB955` when verifying your contract. Make sure to get your actual contract address from the console log output after executing `yarn test-deploy`.
```shell
yarn test-verify <MUMBAI_CONSUMER_CONTRACT_ADDRESS>
```
```shell

### Deploy Phat Contract to PoC5 Testnet
For customizing your Phat Contract function, checkout default function [README.md](./src/README.md) and advanced configurations in [ADVANCED.md](./src/ADVANCED.md) to learn more before deploying to PoC5 testnet.

First you will need to build your function with this command:
```shell
yarn build-function
```
Here is the expected output:
```shell
âžœ  lensapi-oracle-consumer-contract git:(main) âœ— yarn build-function                                                                    ~/Projects/Phala/LensCampaign/DevDAO/lensapi-oracle-consumer-contract
yarn run v1.22.18
$ phat-fn build src/index.ts
Creating an optimized build... done
Compiled successfully.

  17.66 KB  dist/index.js
âœ¨  Done in 3.71s.
```
Now that are Phat Contract function has built successfully, let's deploy to PhalaPoC5 Testnet with the following command:
```shell
yarn test-deploy-function
```
Here is the expected output:
> Note: your contract IDs will very and not be the same as the IDs below.
```shell
âžœ  lensapi-oracle-consumer-contract git:(main) âœ— yarn test-deploy-function                                                              ~/Projects/Phala/LensCampaign/DevDAO/lensapi-oracle-consumer-contract
yarn run v1.22.18
$ hardhat run --network mumbai ./scripts/mumbai/deploy-function.ts

   You also need set up the attestor to your .env file:

   MUMBAI_LENSAPI_ORACLE_ENDPOINT=0x1f6911eaa71405eb043961c0ba4bb6ed7ecc5c8e

   Then run:

   yarn test-set-attestor

   Then send the test request with follow up command:

   yarn test-push-request

   You can continue update the Phat Function codes and update it with follow up commands:

   yarn build-function
   WORKFLOW_ID=0 yarn test-update-function

âœ¨  Done in 36.35s.
```

Go to the [PoC5 Testnet Bricks UI](https://bricks-poc5.phala.network) Dashboard and you can see your newly deployed function.

### Update Phat Contract on Phala PoC5 Testnet
Now let's update the function that we have deployed. Once we have updated the function, we must build the function again.
```shell
yarn build-function
```
```shell
âžœ  lensapi-oracle-consumer-contract git:(main) âœ— yarn build-function                                                                    ~/Projects/Phala/LensCampaign/DevDAO/lensapi-oracle-consumer-contract
yarn run v1.22.18
$ phat-fn build src/index.ts
Creating an optimized build... done
Compiled successfully.

  17.66 KB  dist/index.js
âœ¨  Done in 3.48s.

```
> Note: Before we update the function, make sure to take the `WORKFLOW_ID` from the deployment of the Phat Contract function step and set it in your `.env` file.

Now let's update the function with the following command:
```shell
yarn test-update-function
```
```shell
âžœ  lensapi-oracle-consumer-contract git:(main) âœ— yarn test-update-function                                                              ~/Projects/Phala/LensCampaign/DevDAO/lensapi-oracle-consumer-contract

### Deploy to Polygon Mainnet
Ensure to save the address after deploying the Consumer Contract because this address will be used in the "[Configure Client](https://docs.phala.network/developers/bricks-and-blueprints/featured-blueprints/lensapi-oracle#step-4-configure-the-client-address)" section of Phat Bricks UI. The deployed address will also be set to the environment variable [`POLYGON_CONSUMER_CONTRACT_ADDRESS`](./.env.local).
> **Note**: Your contract address will be different than `0xbb0d733BDBe151dae3cEf8D7D63cBF74cCbf04C4` when verifying your contract. Make sure to get your actual contract address from the console log output after executing `yarn main-deploy`.

## Closing
Once you have stored, the deployed address of the Consumer Contract and set the value in the "Configure Client" section of the deployed LensAPI Oracle, you will now have a basic boilerplate example of how to connect your Polygon dApp to a LensAPI Oracle Blueprint. Execute a new requests and check if your configuration is correct like below:
